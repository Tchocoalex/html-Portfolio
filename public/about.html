<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello i am Alex 
  I am learning web development and having fun doing it.
</p>

<p>I although enjoy nature and anytime I can I go cycle and walking.
  I would rather get wet or sunburned than to be miserable inside.
  My favourite think is playing music and writing silly songs.
  And if you are my friend, you might even hear them.
</p>

<p>Something else about me is that I grew up in the French alps and I got attracted quickly to the joy of travelling and discovering new country with all their cultures.
  Being so attached to my environment and the world, I was drawn to the cause of preserving our planet and to show people how beautiful our world is.
